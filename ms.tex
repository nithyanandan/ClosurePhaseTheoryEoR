\begin{abstract}
Detecting neutral Hydrogen (H~{\sc i}) via 21~cm line emission from the intergalactic medium at $z\gtrsim 6$ has been identified as one of the most promising probes of the epoch of cosmic reionization -- a major phase transition of the Universe. However, the first detection of the H~{\sc i} 21~cm emission from the neutral IGM during reionization remains unfulfilled, due to the experimental challenge imposed by the orders-of-magnitude brighter emission arising from foreground cosmic objects. Current techniques require extremely precise instrumental calibration to separate the weak H~{\sc i} line signal from the foreground continuum emission. We propose using the phase of the bi-spectrum from interferometric measurements to mitigate the requirement for such precise calibration. The closure phase carries information purely about the sky, besides stochastic measurement noise, and is unaffected by antenna-based calibrations and uncertainties therein. We show that the bi-spectrum phase of foreground continuum emission has a characteristically smooth spectrum relative to the cosmological signal. Thus the latter can be separated effectively by exploiting this spectral difference using a Fourier-domain approach, while eliminating the need for precise calibration of antennas altogether that would have been essential to account for phases introduced by the instrument and ionospheric propagation effects in existing approaches. Using fiducial models for continuum foregrounds, and for the cosmological H~{\sc i} signal, we show the latter should be detectable in bi-spectrum phase spectra, with reasonable significance at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$, using existing instruments.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The hydrogen gas that dominates the baryon content of the Universe has undergone what can be called loosely two phase transitions over cosmic history. The first was the transition from fully ionized to fully neutral gas during cosmic recombination $\sim 300,000$ years after the Big Bang ($z\approx 1100$). This epoch has been quantified in exquisite detail through studies of the cosmic microwave background radiation \cite{planck15i}. The second transition is known as cosmic reionization, when light from the first stars and black holes reionized the neutral gas that pervaded the early Universe. Current indirect constraints suggest this second transition occurred a few hundred Myr to $\sim 1$~Gyr, after the Big Bang, or at $z\gtrsim 6$ \cite{gre17}. During this epoch, the photon-to-baryon ratio eventually exceeded unity, making the entire Universe ionized again (except gas bound to galaxies). The astrophysical processes during this epoch helped shape the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure observed today. However, unlike recombination, the timing and process of cosmic reionization remain poorly understood.  The redshifted 21~cm spectral line from the electron spin-flip transition in neutral Hydrogen (H~{\sc i}) atom, has been recognized as the most promising tool with which to unravel the physical processes involved in cosmic reionization, and the evolution of large scale structure during the formation of the first galaxies \cite{sun72,sco90,mad97,toz00,ili02,fan02,fan06,bar07,mor10}.

Our Galaxy and intervening radio galaxies situated between us and the epoch of reionization produce synchrotron emission in the same frequency band ($\sim$~100--200~MHz). This foreground synchrotron emission has a brightness temperature that is some four or five orders higher than the HI line signal from the EoR. However, the synchrotron foregrounds have a smooth spectrum whereas the H~{\sc i} signal from the EoR will appear as small fluctuations superimposed on the smooth foreground spectrum. The hope of separating the cosmic line signal from the Galactic and extragalactic synchrotron foregrounds has spawned a number of low-frequency instruments including the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) \cite{par10}, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) \cite{tin13}, and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) \cite{van13} with sensitivity forecasts sufficient for a statistical detection of the EoR H~{\sc i} spectral fluctuations using power spectrum methodology with $\sim$ 1000 hours of observations \cite{bea13,thy13}. 

However, despite obtaining sufficient observational data, these experiments remain dynamic range limited due to the coupling of the strong foreground continuum emission to the line signal via instrumental effects, such as spectral systematics related to precision of calibration \cite{barry16}, instrumental artifacts, wide-field effects \cite{thy15a,thy15b}, chromaticity in the aperture coverage (or, the synthesized beam) and antenna beam \cite{thy16}, reflections in geometrical and electrical paths \cite{thy16}. These dynamic range limitations have led to upper bounds on the strength of the signal \cite{pac13,ali15,patil17} and weak constraints on the astrophysical parameters \cite{pob15}. 

These experiments operate under the challenge of extreme dynamic range requirements set by the foreground continuum emission $\gtrsim 10^4$ \cite{dim02,ali08,ber09,ber10,dat10,gho12}. Their success depends on precise and accurate calibration of the instrument's spectral response, including the effect of the ionosphere. The difficulty in obtaining such precise calibration \cite[for e.g.,][]{dat09,barry16,tro16} has been a limiting factor in setting limits to the H~{\sc i} 21~cm signal from reionization \cite{ali15,patil16,patil17}. A number of new approaches to achieve such precision in calibration are being explored \cite{liu10,zhe14,sie17,dil17}. Likewise, a number of approaches probing the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic epoch have been proposed \cite{lid07,bar08,harker09,wat14,kit16,ali06,son15,shi16,maj17}. However, all of them are subject to the calibration challenges described above. 

We present an alternate approach using the phase of the complex bi-spectrum (also referred to in radio interferometry as closure phase) to detect the signal from the EoR. This quantity is impervious to antenna-based complex gains introduced by the instrument and the ionosphere, and thus can remove the need for high-precision calibration currently impeding existing approaches. Besides, bi-spectrum phase can serve as a useful diagnostic tool of the system performance (see also companion paper \cite{car18}). Here, we explore its potential as a strategy and its viability to detect the cosmic signal (see also Carilli \& Sims 2016).

\section{Information in Bi-spectrum Phase}\label{sec:CPinfo}

The bi-spectrum in the context of interferometry has been investigated in \cite{jen58,kul89,tay99,tho01} and recently revisited in \cite{car18}, which we summarize here. The bi-spectrum is defined as:
\begin{align}
  B_\Delta(f) &= V_{ab}(f)\,V_{bc}(f)\,V_{ca}(f),
\end{align}
where, $V_{ab}(f)$ denotes the spatial coherence spectrum measured between antennas $a$ and $b$, and $f$ denotes frequency. It can be shown that if the instrument and/or ionosphere introduce complex antenna-based gains denoted by $g_a$ at any antenna $a$, then: 
\begin{align}
  V_{ab}^\textrm{m}(f) &= g_a(f)\, g_b^*(f)\, V_{ab}^\textrm{T}(f) + V_{ab}^\textrm{N}(f),
\end{align}
where, the measured spatial coherence, $V_{ab}^\textrm{m}(f)$, is the sum of contributions from thermal noise, $V_{ab}^\textrm{N}(f)$, and sky spatial coherence, $V_{ab}^\textrm{T}(f)$, corrupted by the antenna gains. The corresponding bi-spectrum is given by:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:bispectrum-terms}
  B_\Delta^\textrm{m} &= |g_a|^2\, |g_b|^2\, |g_c|^2\, B_\Delta^\textrm{T} \\
  &+ g_a\,|g_b|^2\,g_c^*\,V_{ab}^\textrm{T}V_{bc}^\textrm{T}V_{ca}^\textrm{N} + |g_a|^2\,g_b^*\,g_c\,V_{ab}^\textrm{T}V_{bc}^\textrm{N}V_{ca}^\textrm{T} \nonumber \\
  &+ g_a^*\,g_b\,|g_c|^2\,V_{ab}^\textrm{N}V_{bc}^\textrm{T}V_{ca}^\textrm{T} + g_a\,g_b^*V_{ab}^\textrm{T}V_{bc}^\textrm{N}V_{ca}^\textrm{N} \nonumber \\
  &+ g_b\,g_c^*V_{ab}^\textrm{N}V_{bc}^\textrm{T}V_{ca}^\textrm{N} + g_c\,g_a^*V_{ab}^\textrm{N}V_{bc}^\textrm{N}V_{ca}^\textrm{T} + V_{ab}^\textrm{N}V_{bc}^\textrm{N}V_{ca}^\textrm{N}, \nonumber 
\end{align}
where, the dependence on $f$ has been dropped for convenience hereafter unless specifically indicated. All terms on the R.H.S. except on the first line are uncorrelated due to the presence of the noise term and thus average to zero. Hence, 
\begin{align}
  \langle B_\Delta^\textrm{m}\rangle &= \langle |g_a|^2\, |g_b|^2\, |g_c|^2\, B_\Delta^\textrm{T}\rangle. \label{eqn:closure-asymptotic}
\end{align}
The phase of the measured bi-spectrum is independent of the antenna gains and thus identical to that of the true bi-spectrum corrupted only by noise. Denoting the bi-spectrum phase as $\phi_\Delta(f)$, 
\begin{align}
  \phi_\Delta^\textrm{m} &= \phi_\Delta^\textrm{T} + \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N} \label{eqn:cpphase-sum-sky-noise} \\
  &= \phi_{ab}^\textrm{m} + \phi_{bc}^\textrm{m} + \phi_{ca}^\textrm{m} \label{eqn:cpphase-sum-of-visphases},
\end{align}
where, $\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ is the perturbation due to thermal noise superimposed on true phase, $\phi_{ab}^\textrm{m} = \phi_a - \phi_b + \phi_{ab}^\textrm{T} + \delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ and $\phi_a$ denote the phase of the measured spatial coherence $V_{ab}^\textrm{m}$ and phase of complex antenna gain $g_a$, respectively. 

Defining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the visibilities as $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N} = |V_{ab}^\textrm{T}|/|V_{ab}^\textrm{N}|$, where, $V_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ includes both real and imaginary parts, the probability distribution of $\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ depends on $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ as \cite{cra89}:
\begin{align}
  P(\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N}) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} e^{-(\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N})^2} \left(1 + G\sqrt{\pi}\,e^{G^2}(1+\mathrm{erf}\,G)\right),
\end{align}
where, $G=G(\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N})$ is defined by $G(\theta)=\rho\cos\theta$, and $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error function. For $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}\gg 1$, $P(\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N})$ approaches a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation:
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\phi_{ab}^\textrm{m}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\,\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}}.
\end{align}
For $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}=0$, $P(\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N})$ reduces to a uniform distribution in $[-\pi,\pi]$. From Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpphase-sum-of-visphases}), it can be seen that for $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N},\,\rho_{bc}^\textrm{N},\,\rho_{ca}^\textrm{N}\gg 1$, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ will also approach a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation:
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\rho_{bc}^\textrm{N}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\rho_{ca}^\textrm{N}}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}. \label{eqn:cprms-noise}
\end{align}
Even for small values of $\rho$, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ is likely to approach a Gaussian distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem. Fig.~\ref{fig:cpphase-cartoon} illustrates the distribution of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ in the complex plane for high and low values of $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N},\rho_{bc}^\textrm{N},\rho_{ca}^\textrm{N}$. The standard deviation due to thermal noise can be further reduced while preserving phase coherency by averaging independent measurements of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ as:
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{avg}}^2 = \bigg\langle |\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}|^2\bigg\rangle &= \frac{\sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}}^2}{N_\textrm{m}},
\end{align}
where, $N_\textrm{m}$ is the number of independent measurements. It may be noted that the thermal noise contributions in bi-spectrum phase measured on antenna triads that share at most one antenna are still considered uncorrelated, independent of $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ \cite{kul89}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics{phasor}
\caption{Illustration of closure phase behavior as a function of signal-to-noise ratio in the complex plane. $S$ denotes the true signal amplitude and $N$ the standard deviation from noise. The presence of noise introduces a phase uncertainty, whose standard deviation, $\sigma_{\phi_\Delta}$, is smaller if $S/N$ is larger (left) and vice versa (right). \label{fig:cpphase-cartoon}}
\end{figure}

Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpphase-sum-sky-noise}) is valid when the gain terms are purely antenna-dependent, i.e., in the absence of any dependency on the antenna pair or baseline that cannot be factorized into purely antenna-dependent terms. Such baseline-dependent terms will be present when mutual coupling across antennas and correlated errors between the signal pathways of the antennas are significant. Baseline-based responses will introduce departures from Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpphase-sum-sky-noise}) that will depend on the magnitude of such effects. In this paper, baseline-dependent gain terms will be ignored. Paper I presents a preliminary analysis of the magnitude of baseline-based terms in the HERA interferometer. We will explore this issue in more detail in our forthcoming data analysis paper. 

\section{Modeling}\label{sec:modeling}

We describe the instrument and sky model we adopt to demonstrate our approach to EoR H~{\sc i} detection. 

\subsection{Instrument Model}\label{sec:instrument}

We use the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array \cite[HERA;][]{deb17,thy16,ewa16,neb16,patra17} as an example in demonstrating our approach. HERA is located at the Karoo desert in South Africa at a latitude of $-30.73^\circ$. It will consist of 350 close-packed 14~m dishes with the shortest antenna spacing being 14.6~m. Its layout -- a triple split-core hexagonal grid -- is optimized for both the redundant-spacing calibration and the delay spectrum technique for detection of the H~{\sc i} 21~cm signal from cosmic reionization \cite{dil16}. We use the antenna power pattern described in \cite{deb17} to model the visibilities and bi-spectrum phase. In principle, the HERA layout offers redundant, independent measurements of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ on many classes of antenna triplets. 

\subsection{Sky Model and Noise}\label{sec:skymodel-noise}

We construct an all-sky model that includes the realization of a fiducial `faint galaxies' EoR model \cite{gre17} using 21cmFAST \cite{mes11} and a radio foreground model that includes compact and diffuse synchrotron emission from the Galaxy and extragalactic sources \cite{thy15a}. The models chosen here are only for demonstrating the potential of the technique which will be valid for other models as well.

Fig.~\ref{fig:vis-spectra} shows the amplitudes of the spatial coherence spectra measured at the three 14.6~m antenna spacings comprised of the sky (foreground synchrotron and H~{\sc i} from the EoR) and thermal noise contributions with 1~min integration. It is seen that the foreground contributions exceed the EoR signal by a factor $\sim 10^4$ as expected. It is also noted that $400\lesssim \rho_{ab},\,\rho_{bc},\,\rho_{ca} \lesssim 1600$, which implies that fluctuations in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ caused by thermal noise will follow a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation given in Eq.~\ref{eqn:cprms-noise}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{visamp_spectra_asm_eor_noise}
\caption{Spatial coherence amplitude spectra measured on three 14.6~m antenna spacings shown in red, blue and cyan. The black curve shows the typical noise in the measured spatial coherence spectra obtained with 1~min integration. The solid colored curves show amplitudes from all-sky foreground synchrotron from diffuse and compact components. The dotted curves show the amplitudes from EoR signal on the corresponding antenna spacings from a fiducial model obtained using 21cmFAST. Typically, the EoR signal is $\gtrsim 10^4$ times fainter than the foregrounds. \label{fig:vis-spectra}}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:cp-spectra} shows the spectra of the bi-spectrum phase, $\phi_\Delta$, for the foreground and EoR components separately. It is clear that the foregrounds contributions to $\phi_\Delta$ are characterized by a smoother spectrum while the EoR signal is rapidly fluctuating in comparison. To identify with Eq.~\ref{eqn:cpphase-sum-sky-noise}, we write $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ as:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:cp-components}
  \phi_\Delta^\textrm{m} &= \left(\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F} + \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}\right) + \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}
  % &= \phi_\Delta^\textrm{T} + \phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where, the terms in the parenthesis are purely sky-based. $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ and $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ are to be interpreted as perturbations due to the H~{\sc i} and noise fluctuations respectively, relative to the dominant phase from foregrounds, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{closure_phase_spectra_1_15_16}
\caption{Closure phase spectra of individual components in the sky model -- single point source (cyan) with $\phi_\Delta=0$, compact sources (green), diffuse foregrounds (blue), all-sky diffuse and compact components combined (red), and the EoR H~{\sc i} fluctuations (gray) -- for an equilateral triad of side 14.6~m in the HERA-19 layout highlighted in the upper right corner. It is seen that the EoR signal is highly fluctuating relative to all the foreground components. The sharp sign transitions at $\phi_\Delta=\pm \pi$ are phase wraps and are not of a physical origin. \label{fig:cp-spectra}}
\end{figure}

\section{Extraction of the cosmic signal}\label{sec:extraction}

The different spectral characteristics -- smooth $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$ and fluctuating $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ -- indicate that techniques similar to the power spectrum approaches could be employed to separate the cosmic signal from foregrounds but avoiding the need for high-precision spectral calibration that most other approaches rely on.

If a number of independent measurements are available, they could be used to average $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ to reduce the standard deviation of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ by taking advantage of its Gaussian distribution, in estimating $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{T}$ with reduced uncertainty. When $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ is sufficiently low, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ will dominate the spectral fluctuations in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$, while $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$ will be dominant but spectrally smooth. Then the standard deviation in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ will be similar in form to Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cprms-noise}):
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\rho_{bc}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\rho_{ca}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}, \label{eqn:cprms-EoR}
\end{align}
where, $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}} = |V_{ab}^\textrm{T}|/|V_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}| \approx |V_{ab}^\textrm{F}|/|V_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}|$. Here, $V_{ab}^\textrm{F}$ denotes the contributions from the foregrounds to the spatial coherence spectrum. This approximation is usually valid because $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}} \gg 1$ (expected to be $\sim 10^4$) and $V_{ab}^\textrm{T} \approx V_{ab}^\textrm{F}$. 

Thus, when $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}} < \rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ is valid, $\sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}}$ can be used to estimate $|V_{ab}^\textrm{F}|/|V_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}|$, which in turn can be used to infer $|V_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}|$ if $V_{ab}^\textrm{F}$ is known. This has a direct bearing on the EoR H~{\sc i} brightness temperature, $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$, as a function of frequency, or redshift. The accuracy of this estimate will be set by the accuracy of the $V_{ab}^\textrm{F}$ model.

% \subsection{Separability using Delay Spectrum}\label{sec:delay-spectrum}

\subsection{EoR window and Foreground wedge}\label{sec:cp-FG-wedge}

While any method that relies on separating a signal from contaminants using differences in spectral characteristics is applicable, we employ the {\it Delay Spectrum} approach \cite{par12a,par12b} to demonstrate the separability of the EoR signal. Since the $\phi_\Delta$ spectrum can wrap around the boundaries at $\pm\pi$, a Fourier transform of this quantity will introduce non-physical spectral structure. Hence, we define $\xi_\Delta = e^{i\phi_\Delta}$, which eliminates the effects of sharp sign transitions at $\phi_\Delta=\pm\pi$. We perform a delay transform as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:cpdspec}
  \Xi_\Delta(\tau) &= \int \xi_\Delta(f)\,W(f)\,e^{i2\pi f\tau}\,\mathrm{d}f,
\end{align}
where, $W(f)$ is a spectral weighting function that can be chosen to control the quality of the delay spectrum \citep{thy13,thy16} and has a width $B_\textrm{eff}$, the effective bandwidth. From Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpphase-sum-of-visphases}), $\xi_\Delta = e^{i\phi_{ab}}\,e^{i\phi_{bc}}\,e^{i\phi_{ca}}$. Hence,
\begin{align}
  \Xi_\Delta(\tau) &= \Xi_{ab}(\tau) \star \Xi_{bc}(\tau) \star \Xi_{ca}(\tau) \star \mathcal{W}(\tau), \label{eqn:cpdspec-convolution}
\end{align}
where, $\{\xi_{ab}(f),\,\Xi_{ab}(\tau)\}$, and $\{W(f),\,\mathcal{W}(\tau)\}$ are delay-transform pairs, and $\star$ denotes convolution. 

% \subsubsection{{\it EoR window} and {\it Foreground wedge}}\label{sec:cp-FG-wedge}  

Foreground contributions to spatial coherence are expected to be restricted to a wedge-shaped region in three-dimensional wavenumber ($k$) coordinates \cite{bow09,liu09,liu14a,liu14b,dat10,liu11,gho12,mor12,par12b,tro12,ved12,dil13,pob13,thy13,thy15a,thy15b,thy16,dil14}. The maximum extent along $\tau$ ($\propto k_\parallel$) to which foreground contribution in spatial coherence extends is a direct measure of the fastest spectral variation in the foreground component. This maximum delay is proportional to the spacing between antennas ($\propto k_\perp$) measuring the spatial coherence. This gives rise to the {\it foreground wedge}. Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpdspec-convolution}) shows that $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$ results from the convolution of the delay spectrum responses of the phases of spatial coherence of three antenna spacings. Thus, $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$ will also exhibit a corresponding wedge-like behavior corresponding to modes:
\begin{align}
  |\tau_\textrm{F}| \lesssim \frac{|\bm{b}_{ab}| + |\bm{b}_{bc}| + |\bm{b}_{ca}|}{c} + \frac{1}{B_\textrm{eff}}, \label{eqn:cp-FG-wedge}
\end{align}
where, $\bm{b}_{ab}$, $\bm{b}_{bc}$, and $\bm{b}_{ca}$ are the three antenna spacings, and the last term represents the width added by the convolution with $\mathcal{W}(\tau)$. The presence of three antenna spacings makes their correspondence with $k_\perp$ not straightforward unlike in a power spectrum approach. The maximum $k_\parallel$-mode of foreground contamination extends farther than in a power spectrum approach and the {\it EoR window} shrinks  correspondingly along $k_\parallel$. However, the {\it EoR window} still has a finite extent in which the spectral features imprinted by $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ will dominate and contamination from $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$ will be minimal, in $k_\parallel$-modes corresponding to:
\begin{align}
  |\tau_\textrm{F}| < |\tau| \leq 1/(2\,\Delta f), \label{eqn:cp-EoR-window}
\end{align}
where, $\Delta f$ is the frequency resolution, and $1/(2\,\Delta f)$ denotes the shortest line-of-sight spatial, or largest $k_\parallel$, modes in the measurements.

To use existing definitions, we assign an amplitude of 1~Jy to $\xi_\Delta(f)$ and define its delay cross-power spectrum as \cite{par12a,thy15a}:
\begin{align}
  P_\Delta(k_\parallel) &\equiv \mathfrak{Re}\bigg\{\Xi_\Delta(\tau)\Xi_{\Delta^\prime}^*(\tau)\bigg\} \nonumber\\
  &\quad \times \left(\frac{1}{\Omega B_\textrm{eff}}\right)\left(\frac{D^2\Delta D}{B_\textrm{eff}}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{2k_\textrm{B}}\right)^2, \label{eqn:delay-power-spectrum}
\end{align}
where, $\mathfrak{Re}\{\cdot\}$ denotes the real part, $B_\textrm{eff}$ is the bandwidth, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the band center, $k_\textrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\boldsymbol{k}_\perp$ and $k_\parallel$ are the transverse (on the sky) and line-of-sight (into the sky) wavenumbers respectively, $f_{21}$ is the rest-frame frequency of the 21~cm spin-flip transition of H{\sc i}, $z$ is the redshift, $D\equiv D(z)$ is the transverse comoving distance, $\Delta D$ is the comoving depth along the line of sight corresponding to $B_\textrm{eff}$, and $h$, $H_0$ and $E(z)\equiv [\Omega_\textrm{M}(1+z)^3+\Omega_\textrm{k}(1+z)^2+\Omega_\Lambda]^{1/2}$ are standard terms in cosmology. In this paper, we use $\Omega_\textrm{M}=0.27$, $\Omega_\Lambda=0.73$, $\Omega_\textrm{K}=1-\Omega_\textrm{M}-\Omega_\Lambda$, $H_0=100\,h\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ \cite{wmap9cosmo}. In the case when $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$ and $\Xi_{\Delta^\prime}(\tau)$ are identical, $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ reduces to delay auto-power spectrum. In \S\ref{sec:averaging}, we describe how Eq.~(\ref{eqn:delay-power-spectrum}) may be used in different contexts. In Eq.~(\ref{eqn:delay-power-spectrum}), $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ is in units of K$^2 (h^{-1}$~Mpc$)^3$, but these units are relative since the amplitude of $\xi_\Delta(f)$ was chosen arbitrarily. 

\subsection{Improving signal to noise in measurements}\label{sec:averaging}

We require $\sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}} > \sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}}$ such that $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}, \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}} > \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ in order to detect EoR and estimate $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$. This can be achieved by a combination of the following.

\subsubsection{Visibility and Bi-spectrum Phase  Averaging}\label{sec:vis-avg}

If the antenna gains are known to be stable, uncalibrated spatial coherence can be averaged over a time interval above which the measured spatial coherence becomes incoherent in phase. This coherence timescale is usually determined by field of view and antenna spacing, or characteristic timescale for ionospheric fluctuations and/or instrumental changes, whichever is lesser. Beyond this timescale, the spatial coherence is either intrinsically different or has to be calibrated. This will provide the initial $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ and will serve as a basic measurement unit upon which the S/N can be further improved using the following steps. 

Even if the antenna-based gains vary with time, subsequent averaging of the bi-spectrum phase spectra can be performed, at least to the point where the variation due to the sky as it transits the array exceeds the decrease in noise due to averaging \cite{car18}. For the HERA array, an Allan Variance calculation showed this timescale to be $\le 2$min. 

\subsubsection{Averaging in local sidereal time from day to day}\label{sec:lst-avg}

Since the visible sky will be identical at the same {\it local sidereal time} (LST) when repeated across multiple days of observation, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$ and $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ will remain invariant whereas $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ will vary independently across these observations. This allows for coherent averaging of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ and reduce the variance due to $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$.

Day-to-day variations in ionosphere or antenna gains will not affect $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ measured over different days as long as the size of the array is small compared to the predominant spatial scales in the ionospheric variations. For example, this has been observed to be the case for HERA \cite{car18}. In such scenarios, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ can be averaged across multiple days at a fixed LST before computing $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:delay-power-spectrum}), where $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)=\Xi_{\Delta^\prime}^*(\tau)$. 

\subsubsection{Averaging antenna triads}\label{sec:triad-avg}

Depending on the degree to which different triads of antennas in the interferometer array are similar, the measurements across these triads can be averaged coherently in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ or incoherently in $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$. If the triads are identical, they will measure $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ identically as well. This will require redundant placement of antennas such as HERA. Non-redundant spacings of antennas or slight dissimilarities between antenna characteristics or position errors even in supposedly redundant arrays will mean $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ cannot be averaged coherently because $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$ and $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ will not remain constant across the antenna triads. In such a scenario, if these variations are not completely different, and assuming they are random across the different antenna triads, the effective thermal noise contribution to $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ and statistical variations across triads can still be reduced by incoherent averaging where $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ is computed for each pair of triads $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$ and $\Xi_{\Delta^\prime}^*(\tau)$ and then averaged. Measurements across more triad classes -- equilateral, isosceles, and scalene -- could be used to average incoherently in power spectrum to further improve sensitivity analogous to one-dimensional power spectrum approaches although the improvement in sensitivity from such incoherent averaging will not be as effective as an ideally redundant array.

\subsubsection{Averaging contiguous scans}\label{sec:utc-avg}

Measurements spaced in time larger than the coherence timescale in \S\ref{sec:vis-avg} will not be coherent and thus cannot be averaged in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$. However, since the cosmological EoR signal is statistically isotropic in space while the foregrounds are not, the different measurements can be used to first compute the individual delay cross-power spectra, $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ pairwise across all measurements $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$ and $\Xi_{\Delta^\prime}^*(\tau)$ and then be averaged as described in \S\ref{sec:triad-avg}. This will improve sensitivity by reducing both thermal noise and foreground contributions in $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$. 

% \section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Detection of Cosmic Reionization}\label{sec:EoR-detection}

One of the primary applications of this technique is to detect EoR. This is generically applicable to any interferometer array. In this paper, we use the following parameters and HERA as an example to demonstrate the potential of this technique.

We consider the spectral band 100--200~MHz divided into 512 spectral channels, each 195.3125~kHz wide. Using a simulated HERA antenna power pattern \cite{deb17}, we used PRISim \footnote{PRISim is the open source Precision Radio Interferometry Simulator Python package available at \href{https://github.com/nithyanandan/PRISim}{https://github.com/nithyanandan/PRISim}.} to simulate the propagation of a sky signal consisting of synchrotron foregrounds and EoR models, and thermal noise as described in \S\ref{sec:modeling} and obtain the spatial coherence spectra, $V_{ab}^\textrm{T}(f) + V_{ab}^\textrm{N}(f)$, on various antenna spacings for an integration interval of 1~min, which we consider as the conservative estimate for coherence timescale (see \S\ref{sec:vis-avg}) \cite{car18}. These were shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vis-spectra}, which indicate $400\lesssim \rho_{ab}^\textrm{N} \lesssim 1200$ and are in the high S/N regime where $\delta\phi_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ and $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ are well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. 

For bi-spectrum phase, we consider antenna triads forming equilateral triangles of side 14.6~m. For simplicity, we assume that all such triads are ideally redundant in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$, only differing by uncorrelated thermal noise, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{T}$. We assume that the total number of such available measurements to be $N_\textrm{m} \sim 10^6$. For each of these measurements, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ was drawn from a Gaussian distribution using $\sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cprms-noise}). As various combinations of coherent and incoherent averaging depend on the specific instrument characteristics, we keep this analysis generic by assuming there are $N_\textrm{c}$ coherent measurements of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ and for each of these measurements, there are $N_\textrm{ic}$ incoherent measurements such that $N_\textrm{c}N_\textrm{ic}=N_\textrm{m}$. $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ is averaged coherently over $N_\textrm{c}$ measurements, and then averaged incoherently over $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ measured for all non-redundant pairs of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$. For computing the delay spectrum, $\Xi_\Delta(\tau)$, we choose $W(f)$ by applying inverse Fourier transform of the squared delay response of a {\it Blackman-Harris} spectral window \cite{har78} as proposed in \cite{thy16}, using a subband centered at 125~MHz, 150~MHz, and 175~MHz with an effective bandwidth of $B_\textrm{eff}\simeq 10$~MHz in order to minimize EoR signal evolution in the corresponding redshift range.

Fig.~\ref{fig:cpdps} shows the delay power spectrum, $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$, of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ obtained for the subband centered at 150~MHz, a conservative initial S/N, $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}=400$,  for these chosen parameters. The vertical lines show the boundaries of the {\it foreground wedge} (see \S\ref{sec:cp-FG-wedge}, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cp-FG-wedge})) and the foreground contributions decline drastically beyond these boundaries. In the {\it EoR window} at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$, the contributions from the cosmological H~{\sc i} fluctuations, $\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$, dominate over $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F} + \delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$. It clearly shows that $N_\textrm{m}$ used in this example is sufficient to make $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N} < \rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ and the cosmological H~{\sc i} fluctuations detectable in individual line-of-sight modes, $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cpdps_150MHz_nsamples_1048576}
\caption{The delay power spectrum of simulated closure phases that includes contributions from foregrounds, EoR signal, and thermal noise. The vertical dashed black lines denote the boundaries of the {\it foreground wedge} corresponding to Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cp-FG-wedge}). The red curve denotes when only foregrounds are present. The asymmetry noted around $k_\parallel=0$ is due to the anisotropic foreground model employed \cite{thy15a}. The orange curve is for thermal noise superimposed on the foreground component after averaging $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}+\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ with $N_\textrm{m} \sim 10^6$ measurements. The black dotted curve is the delay power spectrum when contribution from a fiducial model of EoR is present, $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}=\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F}+\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{H{\sc i}}+\delta\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$, after averaging same number of measurements. The black dashed curve is the same as the black dotted curve except the fiducial EoR model is 10 times stronger in intensity. It is noted that with sufficient mitigation of thermal noise contributions through averaging independent measurements, the EoR contribution is significantly detectable at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. The significance of EoR detection depends the strength of EoR H~{\sc i} emission relative to the foregrounds. An increase in EoR strength by a factor of 10 shows an increase by $\sim 100$ in power spectrum, indicating that it is a sensitive function of $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$, and thus can be used in inferring the brightness temperature of the cosmological H~{\sc i}, $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}(z)$, if a reliable foreground model is available. \label{fig:cpdps}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Estimation of EoR H~{\sc i} Brightness Temperature}\label{sec:spin-temp}

Another primary application of this approach is to estimate the average EoR H~{\sc i} brightness temperature, $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}(z)$, in various subbands using the separation in delay power spectrum, $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$, demonstrated above. When $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}} < \rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$, the separation between $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ and $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{F} + \phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}$ in $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ is expected to be a sensitive function of $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:cpdps} shows $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ for different values of simulated $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}(z)$, or equivalently, $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ while keeping the foreground model fixed. It can be seen that as the strength of the EoR H{\sc i} component increases, the separation clearly increases in $P_\Delta(k_\parallel)$ at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Conversely, during analysis, based on this separation in delay spectrum, $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ can be estimated in the different subbands, or redshift ranges. This can be taken a step further to estimate $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}(z)$ if the foreground model is known in the different subbands. The accuracy of this estimate will depend on the accuracy of the foreground model. The easiest confirmation of this hypothesis can be obtained by estimating $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$ in different subbands and verifying that there is no separation at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z\lesssim 6$, when the intergalactic medium is though to be fully ionized. This will correspond to $(\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}})^{-1} \ll 1$. Lack of separation in power spectrum will enable placing reliable upper limits on $T_\textrm{b}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}(z)$.

The presence of strong foregrounds relative to thermal noise (high $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$) provides a very reliable phase reference (small $\sigma_\Delta^\textrm{N}$) and thus requires lesser $N_\textrm{m}$ to mitigate thermal noise contributions to insignificant amounts. However, as seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:cpdps}, the presence of strong foregrounds relative to EoR fluctuations (high $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{H{\sc i}}$) implies the dynamic range to be achieved for detection of the HI cosmological signal is correspondingly high and the EoR is detectable only at $|k_\parallel| \gtrsim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. If the foregrounds were instead weaker, they may not serve as a strong phase reference and hence mitigating thermal noise contributions may require larger number of measurements, but it also implies that a lower dynamic range may be sufficient for a detection and more $k_\parallel$-modes may be available due to lesser spillover contamination, thereby increasing the effective sensitivity to the EoR signal. 

\subsection{Prospects and Challenges}\label{sec:prospects-challenges}

%[THE FOLLOWING COULD BE SHORTENED A WHOLE LOT]

We have presented a simple demonstration-scale analysis of the concept behind our approach using interferometric bi-spectrum phase. There are a number of ways analogous to existing approaches in which the prospects of detecting the H~{\sc i} 21~cm signal from cosmic reionization using the bi-spectrum phase can be improved, particularly in the context of a redundant array such as HERA. 

The completed layout of HERA will consist of 350 antennas yielding $\sim$~10--100 times more measurements than at present. Cylindrical or spherical bins in different $k$-modes (including different triad classes) can be weighted optimally to maximize sensitivity \cite{liu14a,liu14b,dil15}. Removal of the foreground contribution, $\xi_\Delta^\textrm{F}$, in $\xi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ could potentially relax the dynamic range required for detection (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cpdps}) and provide higher sensitivity in $|k_\parallel| \lesssim 0.5\,h$~Mpc$^{-1}$.

Challenges to this approach will arise from effects that introduce systematic spectral errors in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cp-components}). Due to the triple product of spatial coherence phase spectra, the {\it EoR window} is shrunk and in general, will have fewer $k_\parallel$ modes where the sensitivity to the EoR H~{\sc i} signal is high. Presence of significant baseline-based gain terms, off-diagonal terms in the direction-independent Jones matrix of an antenna indicative of polarization leakage between the dual-polarization feeds, and direction-dependent antenna gain terms will introduce systematic departures from Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cp-components}). Flagging of frequency channels affected by radio frequency interference will introduce artificially sharp spectral structures which will reduce sensitivity by leaking power into the {\it EoR window}.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The completed layout of HERA will consist of 350 antennas yielding $\sim$~10--100 times more measurements than at present. This will reduce both thermal noise and systematics significantly. 
% \item Analysis techniques such as inverse-covariance weighting \cite{liu14a,liu14b,dil15} could be employed in analyzing data to maximize sensitivity.
% \item Our analysis demonstrates the EoR HI detection prospects on individual classes of antenna triads ($k_\perp$-modes) and $k_\parallel$-modes. Cylindrical and spherical binning in $k$-modes using all triad classes with optimal weighting, analogous to that employed in power spectrum approaches, will further improve sensitivity compared to the simple demonstration-scale analysis presented here.
% \item To reduce the magnitude of continuum (smooth spectrum) power leakage into higher $k_\parallel$-modes, the smooth variation in $\xi_\Delta(f)$ may be removed first before applying Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cpdspec}). This will render $\xi_\Delta(f)$ largely free of foregrounds and further improve the sensitivity. This may also reduce loss of sensitivity caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) by mitigating artificially sharp spectral features (see more discussion below). From this perspective, it will provide significantly higher sensitivity than the conservative approach presented in our work.
% \end{itemize}

% We also emphasize that there are a number of challenges to the bi-spectrum phase approach to HI 21cm cosmology. 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The {\it EoR window} is shrunk in this approach and thus may have smaller number of uncontaminated $k$-modes containing cosmological information
% (\S\ref{sec:cp-FG-wedge}). But given that a major systematic arising from antenna-based calibration is avoided, this trade-off may still be advantageous.
% \item Unlike the power spectrum approach, ours cannot pre-filter for foreground contributions using delay and fringe rate filtering. This is because such filtering introduces spatial filters on the sky structure that depend on the orientation and length of the antenna spacings and thus the three antenna spacings in $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$ will observe a filtered sky that will not be identical thus invalidating the properties of bi-spectrum phase on which this analysis is based. The presence of bright foreground component may provide a higher $\rho_{ab}^\textrm{N}$ and thus a lower $\sigma_{\phi_\Delta^\textrm{N}}$, assuming $V_{ab}^\textrm{N}(f)$ does not depend significantly on the sky. However, our approach without such baseline-dependent filtering in delay and fringe rate has still shown separation of cosmological signal from foregrounds in $k_\parallel$-modes. Further, owing to its simplicity, our approach is not very susceptible to loss of cosmological signal usually introduced by such filters (REFERENCE: CHANG AND KOLOPANIS).
% \item Presence of significant baseline-based gain terms will introduce systematic errors in addition to the noise-like terms in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:bispectrum-terms}). If they are small relative to antenna-based gains, they may be treated as additional perturbation terms in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:closure-asymptotic}). If their variation across different antenna spacings are random and/or spectrally smooth, their effects can still be minimized by averaging described in \S\ref{sec:averaging}. 
% \item Presence of off-diagonal terms in the direction-independent Jones matrix of an antenna indicative of polarization leakage between the dual-polarization feeds are still antenna-based and yet will introduce systematic departures from Eq.~(\ref{eqn:bispectrum-terms}). 
% \item Presence of non-identical antenna beams (power patterns) filters the sky differently for the three components in the triad and thus will introduce departures from expected properties of $\phi_\Delta^\textrm{m}$. 
% \item Flagging of frequency channels affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) will introduce artificially sharp spectral structures which will leak power into higher $k_\parallel$ modes, just as in existing power spectrum approaches. Careful spectral interpolation in flagged channels may be able to recover the smooth contributions from foreground synchrotron. Algorithms to immunize analysis against RFI that are currently in use for power spectrum approaches may be employed to arrest loss of sensitivity in critical $k_\parallel$ modes. 
% \end{itemize}

While we have performed our study in the context of a highly redundant array, the approach is generically applicable to non-redundant arrays as well. We note that many of the challenges above also affect calibration schemes that assume the response of the array can be factorized into antenna-based terms \citep{car18}. The current paper is an exposition of the basic approach to H~{\sc i} 21~cm cosmology using the spectral response in the bi-spectrum phase.  In future work, we will investigate the challenges listed above, such as flagging and baseline-dependent responses, using the HERA data.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

A primary limitation to existing low-frequency EoR H~{\sc i} 21~cm cosmology experiments remains high-precision, time-dependent spectral calibration in order to remove the strong continuum foregrounds. We propose a new approach that uses spectra of the bi-spectrum phase, which represents an intrinsic property of the sky and is thus impervious to antenna-based calibration and associated errors, unlike existing approaches.
  
We employ a delay-spectrum approach to separate the continuum foregrounds from the cosmological line signal in the bi-spectrum phase spectra. Analysis of fiducial models shows that data obtained with the 47-dish HERA in a single season ($\sim$~150 nights) of observing will have the sensitivity to either detect the HI signal from reionization, or indicate clearly what the limitations are, using our approach.  We summarize a few prospects that could improve the analysis, and list some of the challenges that could limit the results.

% \subsubsection{Wide text (A level-3 head)}
% The \texttt{widetext} environment will make the text the width of the

% \paragraph{Note (Fourth-level head is run in)}
% The width-changing commands only take effect in two-column formatting. 
% There is no effect if text is in a single column.

% \subsection{\label{sec:citeref}Citations and References}
% A citation in text uses the command \verb+\cite{#1}+ or
% \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+ and refers to an entry in the bibliography. 
% An entry in the bibliography is a reference to another document.

% \subsubsection{Citations}
% Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly, 
% the entire repertoire of commands in that package are available for your document;
% see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details. Please note that
% REV\TeX\ requires version 8.31a or later of \verb+natbib+.

% \paragraph{Syntax}
% The argument of \verb+\cite+ may be a single \emph{key}, 
% or may consist of a comma-separated list of keys.
% The citation \emph{key} may contain 
% letters, numbers, the dash (-) character, or the period (.) character. 
% New with natbib 8.3 is an extension to the syntax that allows for 
% a star (*) form and two optional arguments on the citation key itself.
% The syntax of the \verb+\cite+ command is thus (informally stated)
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+,+ \emph{optarg+key}\ldots \verb+}+,
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{optarg+key} signifies 
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{*}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or even\\
% \texttt{*}\texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}.
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{pre} and \emph{post} is whatever text you wish to place 
% at the beginning and end, respectively, of the bibliographic reference
% (see Ref.~[\onlinecite{witten2001}] and the two under Ref.~[\onlinecite{feyn54}]).
% (Keep in mind that no automatic space or punctuation is applied.)
% It is highly recommended that you put the entire \emph{pre} or \emph{post} portion 
% within its own set of braces, for example: 
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \texttt{[} \verb+{+\emph{text}\verb+}+\texttt{]}\emph{key}\verb+}+.
% The extra set of braces will keep \LaTeX\ out of trouble if your \emph{text} contains the comma (,) character.

% The star (*) modifier to the \emph{key} signifies that the reference is to be 
% merged with the previous reference into a single bibliographic entry, 
% a common idiom in APS and AIP articles (see below, Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]). 
% When references are merged in this way, they are separated by a semicolon instead of 
% the period (full stop) that would otherwise appear.

% \paragraph{Eliding repeated information}
% When a reference is merged, some of its fields may be elided: for example, 
% when the author matches that of the previous reference, it is omitted. 
% If both author and journal match, both are omitted.
% If the journal matches, but the author does not, the journal is replaced by \emph{ibid.},
% as exemplified by Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]. 
% These rules embody common editorial practice in APS and AIP journals and will only
% be in effect if the markup features of the APS and AIP Bib\TeX\ styles is employed.

% \paragraph{The options of the cite command itself}
% Please note that optional arguments to the \emph{key} change the reference in the bibliography, 
% not the citation in the body of the document. 
% For the latter, use the optional arguments of the \verb+\cite+ command itself:
% \verb+\cite+ \texttt{*}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{post-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \verb+{+\emph{key-list}\verb+}+.

% \subsubsection{Example citations}
% By default, citations are numerical\cite{Beutler1994}.
% Author-year citations are used when the journal is RMP. 
% To give a textual citation, use \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: 
% Refs.~\onlinecite{[][{, and references therein}]witten2001,Bire82}. 
% By default, the \texttt{natbib} package automatically sorts your citations into numerical order and ``compresses'' runs of three or more consecutive numerical citations.
% REV\TeX\ provides the ability to automatically change the punctuation when switching between journal styles that provide citations in square brackets and those that use a superscript style instead. This is done through the \texttt{citeautoscript} option. For instance, the journal style \texttt{prb} automatically invokes this option because \textit{Physical 
% Review B} uses superscript-style citations. The effect is to move the punctuation, which normally comes after a citation in square brackets, to its proper position before the superscript. 
% To illustrate, we cite several together 
% \cite{[See the explanation of time travel in ]feyn54,*[The classical relativistic treatment of ][ is a relative classic]epr,witten2001,Berman1983,Davies1998,Bire82}, 
% and once again in different order (Refs.~\cite{epr,feyn54,Bire82,Berman1983,witten2001,Davies1998}). 
% Note that the citations were both compressed and sorted. Futhermore, running this sample file under the \texttt{prb} option will move the punctuation to the correct place.

% When the \verb+prb+ class option is used, the \verb+\cite{#1}+ command
% displays the reference's number as a superscript rather than in
% square brackets. Note that the location of the \verb+\cite{#1}+
% command should be adjusted for the reference style: the superscript
% references in \verb+prb+ style must appear after punctuation;
% otherwise the reference must appear before any punctuation. This
% sample was written for the regular (non-\texttt{prb}) citation style.
% The command \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+ in the \texttt{prb} style also
% displays the reference on the baseline.

% \subsubsection{References}
% A reference in the bibliography is specified by a \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ command
% with the same argument as the \verb+\cite{#1}+ command.
% \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ commands may be crafted by hand or, preferably,
% generated by Bib\TeX. 
% REV\TeX~4.1 includes Bib\TeX\ style files
% \verb+apsrev4-1.bst+, \verb+apsrmp4-1.bst+ appropriate for
% \textit{Physical Review} and \textit{Reviews of Modern Physics},
% respectively. To display titles for cited journal articles, use the \texttt{longbibliography} class option.

% \subsubsection{Example references}
% This sample file employs the \verb+\bibliography+ command, 
% which formats the \texttt{\jobname .bbl} file
% and specifies which bibliographic databases are to be used by Bib\TeX\ 
% (one of these should be by arXiv convention \texttt{\jobname .bib}).
% Running Bib\TeX\ (via \texttt{bibtex \jobname}) 
% after the first pass of \LaTeX\ produces the file
% \texttt{\jobname .bbl} which contains the automatically formatted
% \verb+\bibitem+ commands (including extra markup information via
% \verb+\bibinfo+ and \verb+\bibfield+ commands). 
% If not using Bib\TeX, you will have to create the \verb+thebibiliography+ environment 
% and its \verb+\bibitem+ commands by hand.

% Numerous examples of the use of the APS bibliographic entry types appear in the bibliography of this sample document.
% You can refer to the \texttt{\jobname .bib} file, 
% and compare its information to the formatted bibliography itself.

% Footnotes, produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command, 
% usually integrated into the bibliography alongside the other entries.
% Numerical citation styles do this%
% \footnote{Automatically placing footnotes into the bibliography requires using BibTeX to compile the bibliography.};
% author-year citation styles place the footnote at the bottom of the text column.
% Note: due to the method used to place footnotes in the bibliography, 
% \emph{you must re-run Bib\TeX\ every time you change any of your document's footnotes}. 

% \section{Math and Equations}
% Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
% symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
% \verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
% be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
% Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
% typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
% respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
% example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
% \verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

% In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
% few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
% default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

% Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is the most common
% type of equation in \textit{Physical Review}:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
% \left(
% \begin{array}{c}
% |{\bf p}|+p_z\\
% px+ip_y
% \end{array}\right)\;,
% \\
% \left\{%
%  \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
% \right\}%
% \label{eq:one}.
% \end{eqnarray}
% Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

% Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
% way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
% on the same line with a one-line equation:
% \begin{equation}
% \left\{
%  ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
% \right\}.
% \end{equation}

% When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
% knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
% use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
% the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

% Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
% using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
% \[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
% q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]


% \subsection{Multiline equations}

% Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
% environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
% to avoid assigning a number:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% {\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
% \delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
% (g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
% &&\times
% [\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
% \end{eqnarray}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
%         (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
%  & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
%   \sum_{\text{perm}}
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}
%  \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
% \end{eqnarray}
% \textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
% equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
% cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
% using a Roman font within a math environment.

% To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
% numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
% \verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% \sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
%         (N^2-1)\\
%  & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
%  \left(
%   \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
%  \right)
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
% \end{eqnarray*}

% To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
% use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
% equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
% (\ref{eq:mynum}),
% \begin{equation}
% g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
% q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{2.6$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
% \end{equation}

% \paragraph{A few notes on \texttt{tag}s} 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ requires the \texttt{amsmath} package. 
% Place the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command before the \verb+\label{#1}+, if any. 
% The numbering produced by \verb+\tag{#1}+ \textit{does not affect} 
% the automatic numbering in REV\TeX; 
% therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, 
% and it must be manually adjusted if other equations are added. 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ works with both single-line and multiline equations. 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ should only be used in exceptional cases---%
% do not use it to number many equations in your paper. 
% Please note that this feature of the \texttt{amsmath} package
% is \emph{not} compatible with the \texttt{hyperref} (6.77u) package.

% Enclosing display math within
% \verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
% a set of equations that are labeled with letters, as shown in
% Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below.
% You may include any number of single-line and multiline equations,
% although it is probably not a good idea to follow one display math
% directly after another.
% \begin{subequations}
% \label{eq:whole}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% {\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
% (g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
% &&\times
% [\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \begin{equation}
% \left\{
%  abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
% \right\},\label{subeq:1}
% \end{equation}
% \end{subequations}
% Giving a \verb+\label{#1}+ command directly after the \verb+\begin{subequations}+, 
% allows you to reference all the equations in the \texttt{subequations} environment. 
% For example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
% Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

% \subsubsection{Wide equations}
% The equation that follows is set in a wide format, i.e., it spans the full page. 
% The wide format is reserved for long equations
% that cannot easily be set in a single column:
% \begin{widetext}
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
%  g_{\sigma_2}^e
%  \left(
%    \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
%   +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
%  \right)
%  + x_WQ_e
%  \left(
%    \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
%   +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
%  \right)\;. 
%  \label{eq:wideeq}
% \end{equation}
% \end{widetext}
% This is typed to show how the output appears in wide format.
% (Incidentally, since there is no blank line between the \texttt{equation} environment above 
% and the start of this paragraph, this paragraph is not indented.)

% \section{Cross-referencing}
% REV\TeX{} will automatically number such things as
% sections, footnotes, equations, figure captions, and table captions. 
% In order to reference them in text, use the
% \verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands. 
% To reference a particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

% The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear 
% within the section heading, 
% within the footnote text, 
% within the equation, or 
% within the table or figure caption. 
% The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command
% is used in text at the point where the reference is to be displayed.  
% Some examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1},
% Table~\ref{tab:table1},%
% \begin{table}[b]%The best place to locate the table environment is directly after its first reference in text
% \caption{\label{tab:table1}%
% A table that fits into a single column of a two-column layout. 
% Note that REV\TeX~4 adjusts the intercolumn spacing so that the table fills the
% entire width of the column. Table captions are numbered
% automatically. 
% This table illustrates left-, center-, decimal- and right-aligned columns,
% along with the use of the \texttt{ruledtabular} environment which sets the 
% Scotch (double) rules above and below the alignment, per APS style.

% \end{figure}

% \section{Floats: Figures, Tables, Videos, etc.}
% Figures and tables are usually allowed to ``float'', which means that their
% placement is determined by \LaTeX, while the document is being typeset. 

% Use the \texttt{figure} environment for a figure, the \texttt{table} environment for a table.
% In each case, use the \verb+\caption+ command within to give the text of the
% figure or table caption along with the \verb+\label+ command to provide
% a key for referring to this figure or table.
% The typical content of a figure is an image of some kind; 
% that of a table is an alignment.%
% \begin{figure*}
% \includegraphics{fig_2}% Here is how to import EPS art
% \caption{\label{fig:wide}Use the figure* environment to get a wide
% figure that spans the page in \texttt{twocolumn} formatting.}
% \end{figure*}
% \begin{table*}
% \caption{\label{tab:table3}This is a wide table that spans the full page
% width in a two-column layout. It is formatted using the
% \texttt{table*} environment. It also demonstates the use of
% \textbackslash\texttt{multicolumn} in rows with entries that span
% more than one column.}

% \end{ruledtabular}
% \end{table*}

% Insert an image using either the \texttt{graphics} or
% \texttt{graphix} packages, which define the \verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command.
% (The two packages differ in respect of the optional arguments 
% used to specify the orientation, scaling, and translation of the image.) 
% To create an alignment, use the \texttt{tabular} environment. 

% The best place to locate the \texttt{figure} or \texttt{table} environment
% is immediately following its first reference in text; this sample document
% illustrates this practice for Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}, which
% shows a figure that is small enough to fit in a single column. 

% In exceptional cases, you will need to move the float earlier in the document, as was done
% with Table~\ref{tab:table3}: \LaTeX's float placement algorithms need to know
% about a full-page-width float earlier. 

% Fig.~\ref{fig:wide}
% has content that is too wide for a single column,
% so the \texttt{figure*} environment has been used.%
% \begin{table}[b]
% \caption{\label{tab:table4}%
% Numbers in columns Three--Five are aligned with the ``d'' column specifier 
% (requires the \texttt{dcolumn} package). 
% Non-numeric entries (those entries without a ``.'') in a ``d'' column are aligned on the decimal point. 
% Use the ``D'' specifier for more complex layouts. }

% \end{table}

% The content of a table is typically a \texttt{tabular} environment, 
% giving rows of type in aligned columns. 
% Column entries separated by \verb+&+'s, and 
% each row ends with \textbackslash\textbackslash. 
% The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
% specifies how data are aligned in the columns. 
% For instance, entries may be centered, left-justified, right-justified, aligned on a decimal
% point. 
% Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, 
% although REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
% table. Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
% command. The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
% bottom of a table can be achieved enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
% environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment. Rows whose
% columns span multiple columns can be typeset using the
% \verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command (for example, see the first
% row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).%

% show various effects.
% A table that fits in a single column employs the \texttt{table}
% environment. 
% Table~\ref{tab:table3} is a wide table, set with the \texttt{table*} environment. 
% Long tables may need to break across pages. 
% The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to specify
% the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} or
% \texttt{table*} environment. 
% However, the \LaTeXe\ package \texttt{longtable} allows headers and footers to be specified for each page of the table. 
% A simple example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
% in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
% distribution.

% There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
% footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
% the bottom of the page or in the bibliography). The easiest
% and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
% command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
% lowercase roman letters. However, it is sometimes necessary to have
% multiple entries in the table share the same footnote. In this case,
% there is no choice but to manually create the footnotes using
% \verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
% \texttt{\#1} is a numeric value. Each time the same value for
% \texttt{\#1} is used, the same mark is produced in the table. The
% \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
% environment. Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for
% Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and \ref{tab:table2}
% for examples.

% Video~\ref{vid:PRSTPER.4.010101} 
% illustrates several features new with REV\TeX4.1,
% starting with the \texttt{video} environment, which is in the same category with
% \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table}.%
% \begin{video}

%   Clip (a): same force.
%   Clip (b): move backwards.
%  }%
% \end{video}
% The \verb+\setfloatlink+ command causes the title of the video to be a hyperlink to the
% indicated URL; it may be used with any environment that takes the \verb+\caption+
% command.
% The \verb+\href+ command has the same significance as it does in the context of
% the \texttt{hyperref} package: the second argument is a piece of text to be 
% typeset in your document; the first is its hyperlink, a URL.

% \textit{Physical Review} style requires that the initial citation of
% figures or tables be in numerical order in text, so don't cite
% Fig.~\ref{fig:wide} until Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart} has been cited.

% \appendix

% \section{Appendixes}

% To start the appendixes, use the \verb+\appendix+ command.
% This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes
% instead of regular sections. Therefore, the \verb+\appendix+ command
% should be used only once---to setup the section commands to act as
% appendixes. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading
% for a section can be left empty. For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
% \appendix
% \section{}
% \end{verbatim}
% will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A'' and
% \begin{verbatim}
% \appendix
% \section{Background}
% \end{verbatim}
% will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND''
% (note that the colon is set automatically).

% If there is only one appendix, then the letter ``A'' should not
% appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix
% command (\verb+\appendix*+ in the place of \verb+\appendix+).

% \section{A little more on appendixes}

% Observe that this appendix was started by using
% \begin{verbatim}
% \section{A little more on appendixes}
% \end{verbatim}

% Note the equation number in an appendix:
% \begin{equation}
% E=mc^2.
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{\label{app:subsec}A subsection in an appendix}

% You can use a subsection or subsubsection in an appendix. Note the
% numbering: we are now in Appendix~\ref{app:subsec}.

% Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the
% subequations environment:
% \begin{subequations}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% E&=&mc, \label{appa}
% \\
% E&=&mc^2, \label{appb}
% \\
% E&\agt& mc^3. \label{appc}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{subequations}
% They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).

% % The \nocite command causes all entries in a bibliography to be printed out
% % whether or not they are actually referenced in the text. This is appropriate
% % for the sample file to show the different styles of references, but authors
% % most likely will not want to use it.
